### Notes:

[Polyfill Test Plan Updates](https://github.com/microsoft/PARAKEET/tree/main/Polyfill)

**Mehul**: Let’s gets started - first agenda Test plan and Update for Parakeet

Feel free to add to the Agenda Items as well

We have published the polyfill and have a lot of detail here

What we are proposing is that we have a 2 stage approach 

1st to set up a functional validation from SSP DSP functionality perspective 

 2nd when we know the functional test is working we want to add an anonymization test  and see what we need in the request 

Validating the PARAKEET API can be used to replace the cookie functionality 

Get access to assess encrypted format and flow and make sure what we are sending to the SSP and DSP is working as expected.

 And we can work together to find the best path from there



* Stage 2 we would like to get some real prod traffic and see what signal we could be losing - each ad server has its own modeling so we would like you to tell us the impact and we can make progress on flows as we go

We would like folks to sign up in an origin trial for 

The DSP can sign up as a reader 

 They can put their JS STK on the sites they are working with and evaluate the response 

**Aleksei:** When is Differential Privacy incorporated?

**Mehul**: in stage 2 we want to make sure there are no issues before this start

 You can fork off your traffic to see how the monetization changes as privacy is introduced

 Could create a tag to show that the privacy trade-off is applied

 We can create this flag and have it flow through as it comes through the request 

Then you can evaluate when the privacy tradeoff is and isn’t applied

 Can we give this responsibility to pass the AB test functionality to SSP/DSP 

**Aleksei:** This means that this bucketing will be on the page 

**Mehul**: Yes, This could be tricky as to how to manage 

We will work on this but First, we want to validate the API flows 

**Pranay**: are you planning on including MACAW in testing

**Mehul**: No not yet we would like to have M evaluated in a sep test - we could enable but not as a mainstream we want to try this w/ a few partners first   3 party computer is a bit expensive 

**Pranay**: w/ o this in place w/ the latency it will be hard to see what the final product will really be like 

**Mehul**:  we would first like to get the cause introduced 

If we are able to clearly get details of what information is being lost 

 We need to make sure PARAKEET is valid first then we can go ahead and add MACAW.

 
**Brian May**: We have this slated over Q3&4. How committed are you to these timelines?

**Mehul**:  We are committed please let us know what you think coils be at risk

**Brian May**: We will have about a month in Q4 before we are completely distracted.

**Mehul**:  the core idea is not that we are closing this in Q4 we want to allow you to apply real traffic - this will vary from Co to co this will be an ongoing task 

A lot of researchers and industry experts - we welcome ppl to try and implement this and welcome code contribution, we still need to finalize the process but that is why we are trying to front-load the system first

**Wendel Baker:** +1 the timeline tQ3 is the prep and Q4 is a race for revenue you may want to focus on some small trials w/ a lot lower stakes 

It will be hard to get this launched  in this time frame  the better model is Q5/6 

This is going to be slow so slow and stable is a good note to hit

**Mehul**:  Yes start a small trial and optimizing - the number of changes needed is the core we are underestimating time o this - because we have a one-year timeline we should not step back we need to keep moving this forward as if the timeline is 2022

**Michael Kleber:** I think everyone is aware that our timeline is moved from 2022 to 2023 I am very sympathetic to where Wendel is coming from but w/ all of the discussion around how long it takes to shift, we are very interested in the open question Is the TURTLEDOVE on-device auction or PARAKEET Privacy-preserving Proxy approach better? - am wanting to hear the input as to what the two approaches do the ads industry at large feel which of these paths is the better way forward.  The longer it takes to make this decision the longer it will take for browsers to make the most useful approach available.

**Wendel Baker:** would like to work on this but there are conflicting isses

**Brian May**: the vast majority of Ad tech is going to focus on Ad revenue Q3/4 

**Mehul**:  When you are ready we would like to get this going so we have time to ramp up -- We would like to get here and enabled (Q3/4)

**Brian May**: We will be able to take a step back in and focus on this in Q1/2  

**Aswath:** in Q3 we can focus and get this set up and then in Q4 take a step back so we are ready in Q1/2 to move forward

**Mehul**: I would like to quickly recap the stage 1 setup

If you have any questions on the timeline and goals - we would like feedback: \

PARAKEET Testing Plan, a Two Stage Approach 

• Stage1 [Q3 2021]: Functional Testing to validate PARAKEET 

• Stage2 [Q4 2021]: Set level of anonymization needed to balance privacy vs. monetization 

**Goals for stage 1**


   • Validate PARAKEET APIs can be used to replace existing 3p cookie-based functionality 
   • Confirm if PARAKEET model that retains auction in SSP/DSP is relatively easy to enable 

**Goals for stage 2**


   • Evaluate Privacy and Monetization criteria for PARAKEET 

   • Influence industry standards by meeting privacy, monetization, and adoption needs 

   • Ask: Ad-Tech partners (SSP/DSP/Publisher/Advertisers) to run functional test during in Q3 2021. 

   • Sign up via Edge Origin Trials Page 



**Fred**: how soon can we provide this feedback, I’m sure there are quite a lot of opinions 

 How can we provide this feedback, what is the right forum for indicating preferences? 

**Erik**: There are a lot of groups, what are the Privacy monetization insights are the insights we are trying to look for

**Michael**: provide Feedback anytime, can provide it right now - it is easy to have a stance but as an engineer, it’s all about tradeoffs - that are diff but necessary as soon as you understand the tradeoffs - I think I and aloof us are eager to hear about it 

It is easy to have an idealistic opinion about which you do/do not like 

**Mehul**: Feel free to share and provide feedback in Web adv group and our biweekly meetings

**Brian May:** wanted to thank the ppl from Edge and Chrome teams it is helpful to have you collectively talk about this 

**Mehul**: We welcome GH issues and questions, please reach out
