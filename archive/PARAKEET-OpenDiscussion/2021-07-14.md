### Notes:

[Polyfill Test Plan Updates](https://github.com/microsoft/PARAKEET/tree/main/Polyfill)

**Mehul**: There are a few Edits to the original explainer that we made last week. Some changes we made based on feedback & issues opened in the GH 

 1. [How multitier auction might work](https://github.com/WICG/privacy-preserving-ads/blob/main/Parakeet.md#multi-tiered-auctionsDirectHeader-Bidding-Integration)


    -how the auction can happen and the bid flow can be added, and details can be passed 


    We are further thinking about latency

 2. [Multiple ad slots on the page](https://github.com/WICG/privacy-preserving-ads/blob/main/Parakeet.md#multiple-ad-slots-for-a-page) 


    We have an array of ad slots so you can synchronize the ads on the page 


     There will be additional restrictions, please go through the added details & privacy & linkage concerns [here](https://github.com/WICG/privacy-preserving-ads/blob/main/Parakeet.md#privacylinkage-concerns)



* [Bid Floor Integration/Partial Fulfillment](https://github.com/WICG/privacy-preserving-ads/blob/main/Parakeet.md#bid-floor-integrationpartial-fulfillment)

 3. How the [reporting integration](https://github.com/WICG/privacy-preserving-ads/blob/main/Parakeet.md#reporting-integration) will work w/ the attribution source

Conversion Measurement API has a similar structure, we will present on our addition on this soon in the WICG but feel free to have a pre-read: [MaskedLARK.](https://github.com/WICG/privacy-preserving-ads/blob/main/MaskedLARK.md) 

There is not a lot of changes to the data flow but more detail added

Please add feedback, we will be editing in the Polyfill framework for now - the reporting is still in the works so we are relying on current trackers to make this work.

We do currently talk about how the current outgoing requests will, it will become a simple ad request config like this one. 

The Open RTB framework can stay as is, we will be updating this flow in the original explainer and polyfill GH details.

We want to support both request formats- some of the header bidding & pre-bid servers are RTB, this is the primary update we wanted to cover

We also have the Test Plan on the agenda, so quickly recapping the last biweekly meeting we are starting to think about a 2 staged approach.



1. A functional test to test & verify data flows and functionalities: ads serving views and impressions, and supporting constructs to create the right revenue and attribution reporting.
2. Then we can start enabling production testing with K-anonymity and differential privacy to see the impact between revenue and privacy.

There was discussion about the Q4 Being an important quarter, the goal of stage 1&2 is to start verifying the flows.

**Brian May**: thank you for updating the documentation it is very helpful

**Mehul**: Recap of  [PARAKEET-Polyfill-Test Setup](https://github.com/WICG/privacy-preserving-ads/blob/main/PARAKEET-OpenDiscussion/PARAKEET-Polyfill-Test%20Setup.pdf) Please chime in and contribute sample code and /or the actual polyfill

If there is a prototype you’d like to explore please add feedback, proposals

If there are no questions we can go through specific GH issues



1. [How do we expect Programmatic Guaranteed and other Private auctions to work through Parakeet · Issue #19 ](https://github.com/WICG/privacy-preserving-ads/issues/19) 

    (Opened by NY Times team ) In the private auction, it’s hard to pass all the parameters w/ the request w/ all the signals in the private auction.


    It opens up more challenges w/ latency and privacy 


    We will keep this open, to continue working on this. If there is an important use case missed out we’d love to get more examples 


 



2. [Allow malicious ads prevention scripts to scan Parakeet ads for malicious activities · Issue #17](https://github.com/WICG/privacy-preserving-ads/issues/17) 

By in large our fenced frame restriction and monitoring will take care of the malicious ad issues but this is also still a work in progress so there will be more to add to this w/ in the Fenced frame workflow.

**Erik**: The Chrome folks had their [shared storage](https://github.com/pythagoraskitty/shared-storage) presentation yesterday so we will continue to look at ongoing discussions and threat models 

**Mehul**: Please review the edits we’ve posted to [Parakeet.](https://github.com/WICG/privacy-preserving-ads/blob/main/Parakeet.md) and the new additions we’ve made [MaskedLARK.](https://github.com/WICG/privacy-preserving-ads/blob/main/MaskedLARK.md)  

**Kelda**: Wanted to give the floor to folks to ask questions and give people time to dive in and process these new updates.

**Mehul**: We can give people time back in no additional questions.
