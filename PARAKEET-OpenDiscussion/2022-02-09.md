#### # Notes:

**Issue 37 - [OpenRTB support in Parakeet](https://github.com/WICG/privacy-preserving-ads/issues/37)**

#### Brad Rodriguez (Magnite): 
you mentioned it being available, maybe default to OpenRTB. Can you update everyone?

####  John Mooring (Microsoft): 
PARAKEET endpoint available for everyone. We’ve been testing with partners. Been working on how the request is transformed into OpenRTB. You can also append an “echo” flag to the URL, that way instead of the request being proxied to the target URL, it instead returns the request body your service would have gotten. That way if you want to develop locally and then subsequently proxy to your service it’s easier than having an emulator.

####  Brad: 
in Edge right now?

####  John: 
the service is available. For the client, still need to go through the polyfill.

####  John:  
in order to leverage OpenRTB in this test, we need to reach out with the domain of the server so that we can enable OpenRTB specifically for that domain, but you may move to that as a default? Is that right?

####  John:  
yeah… if anyone has objections and wants to work with the raw PARAKEET format they can now. I don’t imagine there will be to just moving to OpenRTB by default.

####  Brad: 
it would be the inverse if we wanted to continue to use the PARAKEET format you’d need to switch that. Any reason you’re not using a flag in the request?

####  John:  
it’s one more bit, we could do it if there’s appetite for it.

####  Brad: 
got it, just for a little more privacy not having the client set the bit.

####  John:  
 yes.

####  Brad: 
 the polyfill– has it only been tested in Edge?

####  Erik: 
Chrome and Edge should work; if you run into Tracking Prevention interaction issues please let us know.

####  Brad: 
 there’s info about what the PARAKEET request should look like. For the response, is that passed right through? E.g. JSON right back through?

####  John:  
 yes, at least until client side decision logic is available. The “set serve ads” functionality will run into that. There does seem to be room for the OpenRTB response format and transform it into the PARAKEET response format.

####  Brad: 
 if you were developing a service you might want to just serve one format (that makes sense).

#### Brad: 
 if I make a request and a default changes, I’d like to make sure I get the same response. If I could get flags that PARAKEET could give an error response if the client is not going to get the behavior it previously expected. I can file an issue about this.

Bret Gorsline (Magnite): I’m the chair of the prebid committee. If doing PARAKEET via prebid server, we need a way to identify that a prebid request is from PARAKEET. Is there anything in the request that we can use to trigger off of it to say “oh, this is PARAKEET.”

####  John:  
 not right now, but someone on the github issue suggested how that could be passed.

####  Brad: 
 That was Bret!

####  Bret Gorsline (Magnite): 
 for AMP, we use site.txt.amp (?). That’s a suggestion if this group is amenable to that.

####  John:  
 I have no objection to that. We can make that change promptly.

####  Erik: 
  I did want to add for folks that the PATCG meeting is  3 hour today and tomorrow. We have folks from Microsoft Google and Meta talking about measurement proposals. Continued discussion regarding Fledge and Parakeet may be in the following meetings. But look at the repo and provide feedback. We are looking for folks that care deeply about measurement

We also plan to have this [PARAKEET] meeting as long as we do not have a clear alternate

####  Brian May: 
are we still having this meeting down the road?

####  Erik: 
   in short, until we have a clear replacement forum for the discussions happening here, we’ll continue to have these meetings.

####  Harneet Sidhana: 
reminder– we’re looking for more folks to give the PARAKEET service a try, please engage with us as you can to work with us. Hope to see you at the PAT CG later today, if not the following week.
